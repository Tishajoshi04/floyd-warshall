# floyd-warshall
This Java program implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. It is particularly useful for dense graphs and graphs with negative edge weights (but no negative cycles).
Features:
Accepts user input for:

Number of stations (nodes)

Travel time matrix (graph)

Uses a large constant (99999) to represent no direct connection between stations.

Outputs the shortest travel time matrix between all stations.

Handles graphs with positive and negative weights, as long as there are no negative cycles.
